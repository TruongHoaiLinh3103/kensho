                                    <p data-aos="fade-up">90% of data is unstructured, but 4 in 5 organizations can't effectively utilize it.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li data-aos="fade-up">Unstructured data presents organizations with an opportunity to turn cost into intelligence and competitive differentiation.</li>
                                        <li data-aos="fade-up">Text is ubiquitous in unstructured data, whether emails, articles, documents, audio and/or video transcripts, reports, log files, presentations, social media posts, or any one of many other formats.</li>
                                        <li data-aos="fade-up">Like many organizations, S&P Global is awash with unstructured text data, with millions of documents, articles, transcripts, etc. generated each year. Effectively processing such data was a strategic imperative to find operational efficiencies, new revenue streams and business intelligence.</li>
                                        <li data-aos="fade-up">Kensho developed NERD to help S&P address this challenge. S&P Global has used NERD to great success. NERD has enriched 55M+ docs and has made 600M+ new connections to S&P Globalâ€™s company databases. NERD can do the same for your organization; we are eager to help!</li>
